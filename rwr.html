                    During Summer 2020, I worked as a Software Development Intern for Rhymes with Reason. Rhymes with Reason is a smaller startup with the goal of teaching students vocabulary through the song lyrics of their favorite artists.

                    The summer was very busy because RwR was getting ready to launch a new student platform. Besides extensively testing the functionality of the new student experience, my own independent work involved implementing the new design of the homescreen and signup flows. It was important for the new site to emphasize the changes that had been made. The homepage flow and the signup screenshots down below were all redone during the summer.
