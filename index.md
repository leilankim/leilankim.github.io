Hello, my name is Leila Kim and I am currently a junior at Brown University. I study Computer Science with a special focus in AI, ML, and Security. I'd love to talk; drop an email anytime! 

Recently, I was a Software Development Intern at Rhymes with Reason, a startup that teaches students vocabulary through song lyrics. It was a busy summer because the team was getting ready to launch an entirely new student platform! I primarily worked in **Javascript** to institute a redesign of the homepage and purchasing flows. I also began to do automated testing for the student experience with **cypress.io**, which makes functionality testing much easier. 

Currently, I am searching for a software engineering role for Summer 2021. My ideal role would be on a project that uses machine learning.
